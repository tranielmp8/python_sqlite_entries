# python_sqlite_entries
"""
This is a basic app to help us connect to SQLite using python

We created the outline one what we want the USER to see.
We created a menu which has 3 input choices and depending on the choices from the USER the app will move forward to perform a different task

There are two python files. One is for the logic portion of using python, and the second file is the database file which for the SQL functionality using python
python already has a library/module we can use in order to import SQLite.

I also downloaded SQLite app desktop in order to see the fields I created using python.
If you download the SQLite app you need to create a database and then use the folder address in order to connect to that database
sqlite db browser - https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

Now you are ready to test out the code to see how to connect SQLite3 to python Have fun
