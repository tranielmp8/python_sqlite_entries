This is a basic app to help us connect to SQLite using python

There are two python files. One is for the logic portion of using python, and the second file is the database file which is for the SQL functionality using python
python already has a library/module we can use in order to import SQLite.

I also downloaded SQLite app desktop in order to see the fields I created using python.
If you download the SQLite app you need to create a database and then use the folder address in order to connect to that database
sqlite db browser - https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
